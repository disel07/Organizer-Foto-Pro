## 🌟 What is Photo Organizer Pro?

Tired of messy folders like `DCIM`, `IMG_001.jpg` or scattered files on your desktop? 
**Photo Organizer Pro** is the smart assistant that:
1.  🕵️ **Analyzes** every single file in your folders.
2.  📅 **Reads the real date** taken (not the modification date!).
3.  📂 **Moves and Renames** everything into a tidy structure (e.g., `2023/August/party.jpg`).
4.  🛡️ **Verifies** the integrity of every copy byte-by-byte.
